# Introduction

Hi! I'm Jihad :\)

This is my digital garden \(or personal wiki, notebook, etc.\). My goal is to share all of the ideas I am or having playing with here. 

This is separate from my blog, which is where the really fleshed out messages are published. The digital garden is where I can watch my ideas grow!

## Other work

You can check out my blog, public journal, or newsletter if you're looking for more of my writing. I'm trying my best to keep things as public as possible, both for my benefit and yours.

I'm also on Twitter and are.na.

## A digital garden? What's that?

This digital garden is heavily influenced by [Nikita Voloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev). 

That said, there's a whole community of digital gardeners, doing their best to be lifelong learners, sharpen their thinking, and share it with the world.

You can check out this list of digital gardens to get more inspiration. 

## Thank you

If any of these notes are helpful, you can "buy me a coffee" or subscribe to my newsletter to support :\)
